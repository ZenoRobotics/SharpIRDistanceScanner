# SharpIRDistanceScanner
Arduino Code for Sharp IR GP2Y0A02YK0F Distance Test Mounted on Servo 

The code includes the Arduino - C Code (SharpIRDistanceSensorObjTrack.ino) and the Sharp IR library that gets placed under your Arduino IDE's library files.

The Arduino code does a simple sweep from 0 to 180 degrees and back of the Sharp IR distance sensor mounted on a micro servo, controlled by an Arduino Uno.
